This is a list of programs I keep working on randomly for the arduino. These are created in Arduino's IDE. Each folder contains an independent program.

DualLedBlink - Blink 2 LEDs based on different timers
DualLedFadeIn - Fade 2 LEDs in and out
DualLedSwitch - Toggle between 2 LEDs with a switch
SingleLedFadeInOut - Fade 1 LED in and out
